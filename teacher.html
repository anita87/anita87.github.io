                <p>THE TEACHER</p>
                Teachers are facilitators of education. We help create a safe environment for learning. Students will speak up if they feel that their opinion matters and if they know that their opinion will be respected and appreciated. Students might feel peer pressure in school and among friends. A teacher should create an environment where the student will feel free to speak their mind respectfully and openly. A teacher also should be aware of the different variety of learners in their class and make accommodations so that most students can learn and respect other's learning.
                <p>THE LEARNER</p>
                The learner needs to have as much involvement with his/her education as possible. We need to have the initiative to learn in order to learn. Students can and should contribute with ideas on how they, as a class, can and will help create a safe environment (rules/consequences). Students and teachers are both responsible to make the classroom a safe environment. Students can also contribute with the teacher on the project ideas. Students should find ways to create art not only for the homework, but also that would be meaningful in their lives outside of school.
                <p>THE CURRICULUM</p>
                The Curriculum should be about what the goals are and clear but challenging enough for the students to grow. Lessons should help students make connections to the material learned with their day-to-day life. As they make connections they will be able to retain better the lessons and see the value of what they learn as artists. Lessons should have questions that will help student think outside of the box by creating limitations while they do their projects. Limitations will help them think outside of the box and not fall on the default art making.
                <p>THE SETTING</p>
                The setting where all will happen needs to feel safe and in unity. It needs to be an environment which inspires creativity. The walls should have art work that is historical as well as contemporary, 2D as well as 3D, non-digital as well as digital art to help students see that there are more way of making art. I do feel that the classroom should be organized so that students know clearly where to find the materials they need. Music can inspire but also distract. Because we all learn differently I would have times where I would put music, and other times where it will be a quiet setting to accommodate all learners.
