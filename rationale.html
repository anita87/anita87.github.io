                "The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance" (by Aristotle). Art is a way people can express their inner thoughts and ideas. Some people are better at expressing themselves through writing, others are confident at saying what they think or know, but what about the rest that can't speak or write as eloquently. Art can help those that can't use words to express themselves. It can be frustrating when you want to say something and you can't find the right words to express it. As I was an English learner, what frustrated me the most was when I would say something and people would give me a confused look. I believe that youth have a lot to contribute to our community. They need to be given the opportunity to express themselves and be heard and understood.
                I think art education can help students see that there are other ways to express themselves. Art education is broad enough to help a lot if not all of students find their own way to express ideas. Art has painting, photography, ceramics, commercial art, 3-D art, illustration, animation, installation, etc. Art is not there to teach them what to say, but to help them find the best way to say it and to make it sound/look like their own voices. Once they discover they can speak they will let you know what they think. Being able to discover how to express themselves can help them in their own lives. Communication is an important skill to have for work, school, family, and social interaction.
                Communication involves more than just expressing, it also involves understanding and interpreting others. Art also help them understand others. As they learn this new way of expression, they will also become literate in the language of art and will be better able to understand people whose way of expression is art. As students learn about art history and contemporary art, they will become more familiar with the language of art and how to critique and understand others' point of views.
                Art in education is essential to help them explore new ways of communication. Students can grow their appreciation of art as they produce their own artwork and realize the process is needed to express themselves in this language. As they become more proficient in the language of art they will be able to have discussions with other people who communicate through art.
